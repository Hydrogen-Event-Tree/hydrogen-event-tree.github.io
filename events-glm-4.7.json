It is not clear what caused the leak, but the occurrence of a thunderstorm during the docking operation hints at this as damage/ignition cause. \n\n\n\nA possible root cause may be identified in the unavailability in Germany of helium and its replacement with hydrogen.\n- **Application type:** Non-road vehicles\n- **Application:** Aviation\n- **Specific application supply chain stage:** Hydrogen for buoyancy\n- **Components involved:** gas on zeppelin airship\n- **Storage/process medium:** Gas\n- **Storage/process quantity [kg]:** 18000\n- **Actual pressure\n[Mpa]:** 0.1\n- **Design pressure\n[Mpa]:** 0.1\n- **Location type:** OPEN\n- **Location description:** airport  and/or airborne\n- **Operational condition:** ABNORMAL\n- **Pre-event summary:** There were 14 independent gas carrier cells. The wall of that contained the hydrogen consisted of 2 layers of cotton with a gas-tight film (gelatine) in between. This wall had a permeation of 1 l/(m2 day). The storage quantity was 200,000 Nm3 in 16 gas cells. The actual pressure was atmospheric. \n\nNormal docking procedure was carried out. {Dichristina, M., What really Downed the Hindenburg, Popular Science (1997) 70-76; Tittel L., 1936-1939 LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\", Schriften zur Geschichte der Zeppelin Luftschifffahrt No. 5, Zeppelin-Museum Friedrichshafen, Germany, 4th edition (1997; Bain A., Schmidtchen U., Ein Mythos verglueht, Warum und wie die \"Hindenburg\" verbrannte.}\n- **Number of fatalities:** 35.0\n- **Post-event summary:** It is worth noting that the Hindenburg accident was just one of a number of hydrogen airships that met with an accident involving the hydrogen lift gas. Of 129 hydrogen airships in the early 1900's, over one-third met with that type of accident\n- **Lesson Learnt & Corrective Measures:** Investigation to identify the causes of the accident were conducted for many years. \n \nThe American investigators concluded that the first open flame was on the top of the ship forward of the entering edge of the vertical fin over gas cells 4 and 5. The investigators believe that there was no detonation explosion after the fire began, just a very rapid burning of the hydrogen as it escaped from the gas cells. That  that it was not an overpressure event, just a fire, is confirmed by the post-accident photographs which show that the docking mast was intact and the few injuries to the nearby ground crew and spectators.\nA plausible cause for the leakage was the fracture of a shear wire in the airship hull, a wire might have snapped during the last sharp turn to line the airship nose up with the mast and face into the wind. Possible gas combustion ignitors were discussed, including the pressure sensor, outgoing radio transmissions, mechanical friction heat from the airship structure, chemical reactions, electrical energy and drive engine exhaust. Electrostatic energy seemed the most promising cause. A theory was advanced that a brush discharge from the airship fabric to the grounded part of the airship occurred because of the voltage potential gradients that existed at the field after thunderstorm passage. A brush discharge was proven to be able to ignite hydrogen in tests, and this discharge could not be seen in daylight. The American investigation concluded that a leak in the vicinity of gas cell 4 or 5 formed a combustible mixture and it was probable that a brush discharge ignited the mixture. \n \nThe German investigation of the accident concluded that, while definitive causes could not be found, the most probable cause was that a leak developed in gas cell 4 or 5 possibly caused by a failed support wire inside the airship. The leak caused a flammable hydrogen-air mixture to form in the upper part of the ship's stern, where ignited either by (a) a brush discharge after the ship was electrically grounded or (b) the cover did not ground as quickly, allowing a voltage potential difference to develop and create a spark between the fabric and the aluminium alloy frame. The German investigators, including Dr. Eckener, favoured scenario (b). He stated that a leak of hydrogen on the order of 40 to 50 m2/s could cause the sort fabric flutter described by the witnesses. He also stated that this leakage rate would not immediately be noticed on instruments in the control car.\n- **Emergency action:** Unknown\n- **Emergency evaluation:** -\n- **Release type:** Gas\n- **Release substance:** Hydrogen\n- **Ignition source:** Weather - lightning\n- **Detonation (Y/N):** N\n- **Deflagration (Y/N):** N\n- **High pressure explosion (Y/N):** N\n- **High voltage explosion (Y/N):** N\n- **Flame type:** Fireball\n- **Cloud volume (m^3):** 200000\n- **Sources categories:** ADRC\n- **1st Reference & weblink:** L.
