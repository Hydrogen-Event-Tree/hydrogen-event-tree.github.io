It is not clear what caused the leak, but the occurrence of a thunderstorm during the docking operation hints at this as damage/ignition cause. \n\n\n\nA possible root cause may be identified in the unavailability in Germany of helium and its replacement with hydrogen.\n- **Application type:** Non-road vehicles\n- **Application:** Aviation\n- **Specific application supply chain stage:** Hydrogen for buoyancy\n- **Components involved:** gas on zeppelin airship\n- **Storage/process medium:** Gas\n- **Storage/process quantity [kg]:** 18000\n- **Actual pressure\n[Mpa]:** 0.1\n- **Design pressure\n[Mpa]:** 0.1\n- **Location type:** OPEN\n- **Location description:** airport  and/or airborne\n- **Operational condition:** ABNORMAL\n- **Pre-event summary:** There were 14 independent gas carrier cells. The wall of that contained the hydrogen consisted of 2 layers of cotton with a gas-tight film (gelatine) in between. This wall had a permeation of 1 l/(m2 day). The storage quantity was 200,000 Nm3 in 16 gas cells. The actual pressure was atmospheric. \n\nNormal docking procedure was carried out. {Dichristina, M., What really Downed the Hindenburg, Popular Science (1997) 70-76; Tittel L., 1936-1939 LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\", Schriften zur Geschichte der Zeppelin Luftschifffahrt No. 5, Zeppelin-Museum Friedrichshafen, Germany, 4th edition (1997; Bain A., Schmidtchen U., Ein Mythos verglueht, Warum und wie die \"Hindenburg\" verbrannte.}\n- **Number of fatalities:** 35.0\n- **Post-event summary:** It is worth noting that the Hindenburg accident was just one of a number of hydrogen airships that met with an accident involving the hydrogen lift gas. Of 129 hydrogen airships in the early 1900's, over one-third met with that type of accident\n- **Lesson Learnt & Corrective Measures:** Investigation to identify the causes of the accident were conducted for many years. \n \nThe American investigators concluded that the first open flame was on the top of the ship forward of the entering edge of the vertical fin over gas cells 4 and 5. The investigators believe that there was no detonation explosion after the fire began, just a very rapid burning of the hydrogen as it escaped from the gas cells. That  that it was not an overpressure event, just a fire, is confirmed by the post-accident photographs which show that the docking mast was intact and the few injuries to the nearby ground crew and spectators.\nA plausible cause for the leakage was the fracture of a shear wire in the airship hull, a wire might have snapped during the last sharp turn to line the airship nose up with the mast and face into the wind. Possible gas combustion ignitors were discussed, including the pressure sensor, outgoing radio transmissions, mechanical friction heat from the airship structure, chemical reactions, electrical energy and drive engine exhaust. Electrostatic energy seemed the most promising cause. A theory was advanced that a brush discharge from the airship fabric to the grounded part of the airship occurred because of the voltage potential gradients that existed at the field after thunderstorm passage. A brush discharge was proven to be able to ignite hydrogen in tests, and this discharge could not be seen in daylight. The American investigation concluded that a leak in the vicinity of gas cell 4 or 5 formed a combustible mixture and it was probable that a brush discharge ignited the mixture. \n \nThe German investigation of the accident concluded that, while definitive causes could not be found, the most probable cause was that a leak developed in gas cell 4 or 5 possibly caused by a failed support wire inside the airship. The leak caused a flammable hydrogen-air mixture to form in the upper part of the ship's stern, where ignited either by (a) a brush discharge after the ship was electrically grounded or (b) the cover did not ground as quickly, allowing a voltage potential difference to develop and create a spark between the fabric and the aluminium alloy frame. The German investigators, including Dr. Eckener, favoured scenario (b). He stated that a leak of hydrogen on the order of 40 to 50 m2/s could cause the sort fabric flutter described by the witnesses. He also stated that this leakage rate would not immediately be noticed on instruments in the control car.\n- **Emergency action:** Unknown\n- **Emergency evaluation:** -\n- **Release type:** Gas\n- **Release substance:** Hydrogen\n- **Ignition source:** Weather - lightning\n- **Detonation (Y/N):** N\n- **Deflagration (Y/N):** N\n- **High pressure explosion (Y/N):** N\n- **High voltage explosion (Y/N):** N\n- **Flame type:** Fireball\n- **Cloud volume (m^3):** 200000\n- **Sources categories:** ADRC\n- **1st Reference & weblink:** L.

There was an identical accident in 1983 (although the source does not tell if in the same facility), but apparently the plant management was not aware of it, or did not recognise the return of experience.  \n(b) Non-industrial wastes such as domestic wastes is a mix of diverse materials, including hazardous ones. T should be possible to execute some sort of control on the materials arriving. The lack of control on the type of waste was at the basis of this incident: a facility for non-industrial waste accepted a large quantity of aluminium, which should have been labelled as industrial waste.\n\nCORRECTIVE MEASURES\n1. As waste including aluminium easily forms a clinker, which causes an ash blockage, it should not be incinerated in large quantities.\n2.

These were due to a large quantity of aluminium which produced a solid lump of ash. The explosion occurred during clean-up operation of this lump piled in a hopper chute at the lower part of the incinerator. In an attempt to favour the cleaning process, large quantities of water were injected, which reacted with the aluminium to form flammable atmosphere consisting mainly of hydrogen. The hydrogen entered then in contact with air when the inspection door was opened, ignited and exploded.\n",

The corrosion was caused by corrosive substances such as ammonium hydroxide and chlorine which was included in the injection water. In addition, a dummy support had been welded to the cap, so that thermal stress might could have also contributed to the loss of containment. \n\nThe ROOT CAUSE is a not optimal risk assessment and management of changes. \nFour years before the incident, a heat exchanger had been added and a rearrangement of heat exchangers at the outlet of the reactor was carried out to rationalize energy recovery. This caused an increase of the concentration of corrosive substances at the heat exchanger outlet. \nDespite that fact that the plan was controlling the concentration of corrosive substances, no one believed the wall thickness at the piping dead-end part would be reduced by corrosion. Therefore it was not so the part of the plan for wall thickness measurements.\n- **Application type:** Chemical industry\n- **Application:** Hydrodesulphurisation process\n- **Specific application supply chain stage:** Hydrogen as process gas\n- **Components involved:** dead-end piping, heat exchanger\n- **Storage/process medium:** Gas\n- **Location type:** CONFINED\n- **Location description:** industrial area\n- **Operational condition:** NORMAL\n- **Pre-event summary:** Four years before the incident, a heat exchanger had been added and a rearrangement of heat exchangers at the outlet of the reactor was carried out to rationalize energy recovery.\n- **Number of injured persons:** 0.0\n- **Number of fatalities:** 0.0\n- **Currency:** Yen\n- **Property loss (onsite):** 480000000\n- **Post-event summary:** The piping, a fin-fan cooler, instrumentation devices and a structure etc., installed near the high-pressure separator burned out. \nAt the factory, windows of 57 buildings in a 1 km radius were damaged. \nOutside the factory, windows of six buildings within a 2.5 km radius were damaged, and 14,000 cubic meters of hydrogen and 30 kL of vacuum gas oil burned out.\n- **Lesson Learnt & Corrective Measures:** LESSON LEARNT\nA. The possibility of a failure due to corrosion had clearly not considered when performing a risk assessment of the modifications executed on the facility. \nB. Plants with same processes are not necessarily characterised by exactly the same hazards and risks. A full understanding of each plans is crucial to guarantee its safety.\nC. Specifically regarding dead-end piping, they are the cause of several problems, because concentrations of corrosive substances increases locally quicker than in part characterised by high flows of liquid or gases. Therefore, specific safety provisions are required for these areas.\n\nCORRECTIVE MEASURES\n1. The management system of operations and facilities was strengthened to be able to monitor abnormal phenomena such as local corrosion and to respond properly.\n2. The safety review system for modifying new facilities was improved. \n3. The risk assessment of existing facilities was re-evaluated.\n4. All refineries with the same kind of desulphurisation unit were required to inspect dead-end piping in the areas similar to those where the incident occurred. \n5. They were also recommended to perform a safety review of third operational and facilities management system.\n- **Emergency action:** An operator shut down the plant immediately after the accident. The fire brigade arrived and sprayed water to cool peripheral equipment. They also used foam fire extinguishers to extinguish the fire.\n- **Release type:** gas\n- **Release substance:** hydrogen\n- **Hydrogen release concentration (%):** 1200 kg\n- **Sources categories:** JST\n- **1st Reference & weblink:** JST failures database:\nhttps://www.shippai.org/fkd/en/cfen/CC1000003.html\n(accessed Dec 2023)\n- **2nd Reference &weblink:** JST failures database:\nhttps://www.shippai.org/fkd/en/cfen/CC1000003.html\n(accessed Dec 2023)\n\n## Description\nThe incident affected at an indirect oil desulfurization unit, and originated at a piping at the outlet of a heat exchanger.

The report estimated that such a shock wave would require 18 Nm3 (1.5 kg) of hydrogen in a deflagration causing a free spherical shockwave and that 10% of the flammable mixture was burned in the explosion, which is consistent with the release of 180 Nm3. The method used to derive the estimation is not stated, though it is likely to be a simple TNT equivalence type method.\n- **Lesson Learnt & Corrective Measures:** It is not known if the official investigation report issued recommendations or legal requirements. nevertheless, regular inspection procedure should be in place to monitor high-pressure connections degradation, and shut-off valves should be used to control release from the individual cylinders in the rack.
